# Product Recommendation Example

This example demonstrates semantic product recommendations using DAT1 embeddings.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your `DAT1_API_KEY`
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to execute the recommendation script

The script will generate embeddings for a product catalog and recommend products based on user preferences using cosine similarity.
